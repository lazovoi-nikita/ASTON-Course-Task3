# ASTON-Course-Task3
Homework for the fourth lesson at the ASTON courses.

This homework consists of three tasks.

Task 1: Create an ArrayList, Linkedlist, and HashMap, add elements to the beginning, end, and middle, delete an element, and list elements.

Task 2: Write your own collection implementation to choose from LinkedList or ArrayList (both options are available). 
There should be basic add, get, remove, addAll methods (another collection as a parameter), the rest is at your discretion.
Plus, write an implementation of bubble sorting with a flag that stops sorting if the collection is already sorted.

Task 3: For these collections, make a constructor that will take another collection as parameters and initialize with elements from this collection. 
The second part is to make the sorting method static, this method will also take some kind of collection and sort it. (Analogous to Collections.sort()).
That is, think about which keyword(extends or super) would be better used for these two tasks.
